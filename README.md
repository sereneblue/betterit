betterit is a simple read-only client for Reddit lurkers. 

Features:

- Pin subreddits for quick access
- Toggle between a light and dark theme
- Hide comment upvotes
- A smoother experience compared to the regressive redesign

You can access betterit by clicking [here](https://sereneblue.github.io/betterit) or cloning this repository.

If you want to use betterit locally, clone this repository and run 

```
npm run serve
```

You can also build the app by running

```
npm run build
```

### Credits

The color scheme is inspired by the Sublime Text theme [ayu](https://github.com/dempfi/ayu).

### Disclaimer

There's a lot that betterit is missing (gilded posts, stickied threads, pagination, etc), however, I have no plans to develop it further. This is merely a simple project to learn more about VueJS. :)
